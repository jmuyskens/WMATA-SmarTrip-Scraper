WMATA SmarTrip Usage Python Screen Scraper

Written by Justin Grimes (@justgrimes) & Josh Tauberer (@joshdata)

Simple python script that scrapes a SmarTrip user's transit usage data from WMATA website (http://smartrip.wmata.com)
Script authenticates into WMATA website using Mechanize library and then extracts data from HTML tables using Beautiful Soup library then writes lovely clean CSV files. Feel free to use; I claim nothing; To map returned WMATA station "short names" to proper full name to get latitude and longitude use this crosswalk:
